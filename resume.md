Interests
--------------------

The Open Source Initiative (OSI) - Individual Member
:   Open Source software is a fundamental part of our society and i felt that
    after using open source software for more than 10 years, supporting the OSI
    was the right thing to do.




Other interests
:   **Java:** The java ecosystem is a huge and vibrant ecosystem and takes a life
    time to master. Some of many the subjects I've been studying:

    * GraalVM and AOT compilation in serverless environments
    * Dependency injection in serverless environments using Dagger

:   **RabbitMQ:** Message Queues are a key piece of any distributed system. I do a lot of research
    about MQ patterns and how to solve some common problems.
    I also contribute to RabbitMQ mailing list every time i have an opportunity.

:   **Kotlin and other functional languages:** Expressive code is a great way to reduce the number of bugs
    and increase productivity. I've been looking at other languages and tools to increase productivity
    on the JVM platform.

:   **Lisp, Scheme and Racket :**  On free my time I've been learning Racket. My interest in such languages 
    is due to its simplicity. This simplicity and flexibility makes them very powerful and the perfect vehicle to 
    implement new programming concepts without the need to change the language.



Other
----------------------------------------

* Languages:

     * Portuguese (Native speaker)
     * English (Professional Speaker)
     * Spanish (Basic understanding)
