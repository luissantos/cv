Interests
--------------------

Other interests
:   **Java:**

    * GraalVM and AOT compilation in serverless environments
    * Dependency injection in serverless environments using Dagger
    * Kotlin - Kotlin modern and expressive features deliver great productivity at a lower entry barrier. A great alternative to Java.
    * Clojure - Modern lisp on the jvm and javascript

:   **RabbitMQ:** Message Queues are a key piece of any distributed system. I do a lot of research about MQ patterns and how to solve some common problems. I also contribute to RabbitMQ mailing list every time I have an opportunity

:   **Arduino and digital electronics:** One of my hobbies is to build small digital circuits that let control devices around the house and in the process improve my understanding about the different technologies available to consumers. DIY is a fun and pragmatic way of exploring the concepts of Computing and IoT.

:   **Lisp, Scheme and Racket :**  On free my time I've been learning Racket. My interest in such languages is due to its simplicity. This simplicity and flexibility make them very powerful and the perfect vehicle to 
    implement new programming concepts without the need to change the language
