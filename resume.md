Interests
--------------------

The Open Source Initiative (OSI) - Individual Member
:   Open Source software is a fundamental part of our society and i felt that
    after using open source software for more than 10 years, supporting the OSI
    was the right thing to do.




Other interests
:   **Java:** The java ecosystem is a huge and vibrant ecosystem and takes a life
    time to master. Some of many the subjects I've been studying:

    * Garbage collector and memory management
    * Class loader and byte code manipulation
    * Java agent - How to debug and profile production code

:   **RabbitMQ:** Message Queues are a key piece of any distributed system. I do a lot of research
    about MQ patterns and how to solve some common problems.
    I also contribute to RabbitMQ mailing list every time i have an opportunity.

:   **Kotlin and other functional languages:** Expressive code is a great way to reduce the number of bugs
    and increase productivity. I've been looking at other languages and tools to increase productivity
    on the JVM platform.



Other
----------------------------------------

* Languages:

     * Portuguese (Native speaker)
     * English (Professional Speaker)
     * Spanish (Basic understanding)
